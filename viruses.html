            <h1> What is a Computr Virus ?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>A computer virus is a malicious piece of computer code designed to spread from device to device. A subset of
            malware, these self-copying threats are usually designed to damage a device or steal data.</p>

        <div class="header">
            <h1>How do it spread? </h1>
        </div>
        <p>Viruses can be spread several ways, including via networks, discs, email attachments or external storage
            devices like USB sticks. Since connections between devices were once far more limited than today, early
            computer viruses were commonly spread through infected floppy disks.

            Today, links between internet-enabled devices are for common, providing ample opportunities for viruses to
            spread. According to the U.S.</p>

            <h1>Examples</h1>
        </div>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Worms</b>  - A worm is a type of virus that, unlike traditional viruses, usually does not require the action of a
                    user to spread from device to device.</li>
                <li><b>Trojans</b> - As in the myth, a Trojan is a virus that hides within a legitimate-seeming program to spread
                    itself across networks or devices.</li>
                <li><b>Ransomware</b>  - Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user’s files and demands a ransom for its
                    return. Ransomware can be, but isn’t necessarily, spread through computer viruses.</li>
